# Telco-Customer-Churn-Ensemble-ML
End-to-end ML project that predicts customer churn using a stacked ensemble model combining Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost. The project addresses class imbalance with SMOTE, performs hyperparameter optimization using RandomizedSearchCV, and evaluates performance using recall-focused metrics, ROC, and Precision–Recall curves.
